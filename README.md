# Reddit Clone Project (Next.js 15/TailwindCSS/Next Auth/Server Components)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Goals

This repository serves as a practical project for recapping my existing knowledge of Next.js 14 while learning and applying new features introduced in Next.js 15. The focus is on refining my understanding of advanced concepts and best practices in modern Next.js development.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project.

Start editing by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you make changes.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family designed by Vercel.

## Recapping Next.js 14 Knowledge & Learning in Next.js 15

I already have a strong grasp of Next.js 14, including:
- High-performance web app development using Next.js.
- Next.js caching strategies for improved response times.
- Authentication with Next Auth.
- Utilizing Server Components for better streaming interfaces.
- Optimizing image loading with Next.js Image component.
- Modern form validation with React's useFormState hook.

With Next.js 15, I am focusing on:
- **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**: Enhancing performance by combining static and dynamic rendering.
- **New Middleware Capabilities**: Expanding control over request/response handling.
- **Improved Turbopack Integration**: Faster builds and optimized hot module replacement.
- **Better Edge Runtime Support**: Leveraging serverless optimizations.
- **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**: Streamlined debugging and logging features.
